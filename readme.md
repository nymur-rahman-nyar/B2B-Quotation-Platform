# Web Quote App – Secure B2B Quotation Platform

(Note this website is still in production and backend is hosted on Render free tier plan. The back end will start after 20 seconds so please be patient ) 

A secure full-stack web application that enables businesses to generate, manage, and send quotations while enforcing strong access control and backend security practices.

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real world B2B system where confidentiality, authorization, and secure data handling are essential. It combines modern full-stack development with applied cybersecurity principles.

## Full-Stack Development

**Technology Stack:** MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js (MERN)

- Developed a responsive web application for creating and managing business quotations
- Implemented separate client and admin interfaces
- Designed RESTful APIs for controlled CRUD operations
- Integrated persistent data storage using structured database models
- Ensured clean separation between frontend and backend architecture

## Cybersecurity and Secure Design

- Implemented authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict system access
- Enforced role-based access control to isolate client and administrative data
- Applied backend input validation to prevent unauthorized data manipulation
- Designed APIs following least-privilege and secure-by-design principles
- Reduced attack surface through controlled data exposure

## Why This Project

This project demonstrates the ability to:

- Build production-style full-stack applications
- Apply cybersecurity concepts within real development workflows
- Design systems with security integrated from the start

## Planned Enhancements after migrating to aws

- Token-based authentication using JWT
- Rate limiting and request logging
- Security testing and vulnerability assessment
